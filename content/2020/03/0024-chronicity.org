* chronicity :datetime:

This library works well together with [[http://quickdocs.org/local-time/][local-time]].
It is amazing because it is able to parse human-readable strings into
the *local-time:timestamp* objects:

Being able to use natural language to enter dates into the computer, is
very convenient.

Well done, [[https://twitter.com/chaitanya_gupta][@chaitanya_gupta]]!

- [[https://twitter.com/RainerJoswig][@RainerJoswig]] noted that similar functionality was implemented in Lisp
  Machines in 1980. He have a [[http://lispm.de/source/lispm-system-78-48/lmio1/timpar.lisp][link to these ancient sources]].
