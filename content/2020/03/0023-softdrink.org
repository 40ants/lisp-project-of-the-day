* softdrink :web:

This is a small library by [[https://twitter.com/shinmera][@shinmera]]. It is able to extract CSS from
HTML or embed it back.

"Softdrink" could be useful, for example, to produce HTML emails. Most
email software ignores external stylesheets but is able to use styles,
embedded into HTML nodes.

Unfortunately, even the README examples don't work. Probably because
the library's dependencies were changed in the last few years.

I've created an issue about these problems:

Hope, @shinmera will help to figure out, how to fix the problems.
