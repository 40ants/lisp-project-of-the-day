* cl-gearman :network:rpc:multiprocessing:

Yesterday, we [[https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/2020/06/0094-lfarm.html][talked about]] distributing jobs across a cluster using
~lfarm~. ~lfarm~ is not well suited to environments where worker hosts can
go down and return back later.

[[http://gearman.org/][Gearman]] is the RPC server. Multiple workers can connect to this server
and advertise which functions they are supporting. A client can call
these functions and receive a result.

Here is the diagram showing how does it work in the common case:

[[../../media/0095/gearman-cluster.png]]

A cool feature of Gearman is its language independence. Workers can be
written in any language. This means that in your distributed system some
functions can be written in Lisp, others in Python or even in Bash and
some UNIX tools.

Now we'll see how to write a simple worker in Common Lisp and call
it. But first, let's start Gearman server in the Docker container:

#+begin_src bash

#+end_src

Next, we need to start a simple worker which supports two functions. It can
reverse any string and report about it's Lisp implementation:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (cl-gearman:with-worker (worker "localhost:4730")
             (cl-gearman:add-ability worker "get-implementation"
                                     (lambda (arg job)
                                       (declare (ignorable arg job))
                                       (format nil "~A ~A"
                                               (lisp-implementation-type)
                                               (lisp-implementation-version))))
             (cl-gearman:add-ability worker "reverse"
                                     (lambda (arg job)
                                       (declare (ignorable job))
                                       (reverse arg)))
             (loop (cl-gearman:work worker)))

#+end_src


This is how we can call these functions from the console:

#+begin_src bash

[art@poftheday:~]% echo 'Hello Lisp World!' | gearman -f reverse
!dlroW psiL olleH

[art@poftheday:~]% echo '' | gearman -f get-implementation
SBCL 2.0.2

#+end_src

This way you can communicate with the Lisp from the outer world.

If we want to call these functions from other Lisp program, then we can
do it like this:

#+begin_src lisp

OTHER-LISP> (cl-gearman:with-client (client "localhost:4730")
              (format t "~A"
                      (cl-gearman:submit-job client "reverse"
                                             :arg "Hello Lisp World!")))
!dlroW psiL olleH

OTHER-LISP> (cl-gearman:with-client (client "localhost:4730")
              (format t "~A"
                      (cl-gearman:submit-job client "get-implementation")))
SBCL 2.0.2

#+end_src

Gearman uses a very simple protocol. Every function accepts only one
string as its argument. If you want to pass something complex, you'll
need to use some sort of serialization.

For example, here is how I use ~cl-store~ and ~base64~ to pass lisp
data-structures between a worker and a client in Ultralisp.org:

https://github.com/ultralisp/ultralisp/blob/f52411bd89dc5b0bcb6701e4ba0712dd5aee128b/src/rpc/core.lisp#L23-L47

That is it for today. Play with both ~lfarm~ and ~cl-gearman~ to decide
which one is better suited for your task.
