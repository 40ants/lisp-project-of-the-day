This project is still in the development phase but I like its idea. ~Breeze~
tries to improve the development process. Especially interesting feature -
it's ability to run tests on function redefinition!

To make it work, you have to use ~defun~ and ~deftest~ from the ~breeze~:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (breeze:defun foo ()
             100)

;; When we define the test, it is immediately
;; runned in a separate thread:
POFTHEDAY> (breeze:deftest test-foo
             (unless (= (foo) 42)
               (error "Foo should return 42")))
Running all tests...
WARNING: 
Test TEST-FOO failed with condition Foo should return 42

Test "TEST-FOO" failed with condition:
"Foo should return 42"
Done [0/1] tests passed.

;; Now I'm going to fix it.
;; Pay attention on output. Breeze automatically
;; runs tests for 'foo function in a separate thread:
POFTHEDAY> (breeze:defun foo ()
             42)
Running all tests....
Done [1/1] tests passed.

;; Now let's break it again!
POFTHEDAY> (breeze:defun foo ()
             77)
FOO
Running all tests...
WARNING: 
Test TEST-FOO failed with condition Foo should return 42

Test "TEST-FOO" failed with condition:
"Foo should return 42"
Done [0/1] tests passed.

#+end_src

There is also some extension for Emacs and SLIME, but I didn't test it
yet. I hope the author will make this system more usable.

The first feature which comes in mind is support for existing
unit-testing frameworks. The second is an indicator for Emacs mode-line
if some tests failed after I hit ~C-c C-c~.

To conclude, make good tooling! Tooling should be convenient!
