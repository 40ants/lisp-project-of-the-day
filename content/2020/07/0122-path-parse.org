This is a small utility library by Fernando Borretti. The only function
it has is ~PATH~ variable parsing. But it does it really well.

~Path-parse~ works on Windows and Unix (OSX):

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (path-parse:path)

(#P"/Users/art/.roswell/bin/"
 #P"/Users/art/.bin/"
 #P"/Users/art/.dotfiles/bin/"
 #P"/usr/local/bin/"
 #P"/usr/bin/"
 #P"/bin/"
 #P"/usr/sbin/"
 #P"/sbin/")

#+end_src

That is it for today. Tomorrow I'll try to find something more
interesting!
