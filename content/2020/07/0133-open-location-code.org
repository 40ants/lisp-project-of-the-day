This is an interesting way to encode coordinates on the planet Earth.

These codes can be short enough to remember them, and they are
pronounceable. What is essential – they supported by Google.

For example, I have an architectural landmark in nearby Bykovo village -
the [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Усадьба_Быково][Vorontcov-Dashkov's mansion]]. Its coordinates are ~55.608093~,
~38.048927~ or ~55°36'29.1"N 38°02'56.1"E~.

This building has no address, but we can get an "open location code" for
its location on Google Maps:

[[../../media/0133/map.png]]

~J25X+6H~ is the shortened open location code for this location.

You can get the full code using latitude, longitude and one line of
Lisp code:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (open-location-code:encode
            55.608093
            38.048927)
"9G7WJ25X+6H"

#+end_src

The code ~9G7WJ25X+6H~ is full. It has all information to get back our latitude
and longitude:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (open-location-code:decode "9G7WJ25X+6H")
#<OPEN-LOCATION-CODE:CODE-AREA {1002BF7E13}>
:FULL

POFTHEDAY> (open-location-code:south-west-corner *)
6951/125 (55.608)
304391/8000 (38.048874)

#+end_src

But for short code this will not work:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (open-location-code:decode "J25X+6H")
#<OPEN-LOCATION-CODE:CODE-AREA {10067CAAB3}>
:SHORT

POFTHEDAY> (open-location-code:south-west-corner *)
76/125 (0.608, 304/5%)
391/8000 (0.048875, 391/80%)

#+end_src

To get the coordinates, you need to "recover" the full code first. This
is done using some reference point. For example, we can take the nearest
village's coordinates as the reference point:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (open-location-code:recover
            "J25X+6H"
            55.634068
            38.044629)
"9G7WJ25X+6H"

#+end_src

This is the same code we've received from mansion's coordinates. You
can open the Google Maps and search the code ~9G7WJ25X+6H~ to check it. In
real life short codes are used together with the name of the nearest
city, like ~J25X+6H Быково, Московская обл.~

That is for today. For me, open location codes were an exciting
discovery. Didn't hear about them before.
