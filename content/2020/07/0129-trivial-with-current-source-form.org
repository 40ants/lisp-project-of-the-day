This library is a trivial compatibility layer. It helps to provide a
hints to the Lisp compiler. These hints allow the compiler to show more
precise error messages when error happens during the macro-expansion.

Here is an example I've stole from the library's documentation. To show
you how this works in dynamic, I've recorded a GIF image:

[[../../media/0129/with-current-source-form.gif]]

That is it. You just wraps some part of the macro-processing code with
~with-current-source-form~ and says: "Hey, compiler! Here is a s-expr I'm
curently processing. If some shit will happen, let the user know."

As I said before, this library is a compatibility layer. Only SBCL and
Clasp are supported for now. On other implementations the macro will do
nothing.
