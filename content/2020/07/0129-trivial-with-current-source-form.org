This library is a compatibility layer. It helps to provide hints to the
Lisp compiler. Hints allow the compiler to show more precise error
messages when error happens during the macro-expansion.

Here is an example I've stolen from the library's documentation. To show
you how this works in dynamic, I've recorded a GIF image.

Pay attention, without the hint compiler highlights "even-number-case"
top-level form:

[[../../media/0129/with-current-source-form.gif]]

That is it. You just wrap some part of the macro-processing code with
~with-current-source-form~ and say: "Hey, compiler! Here is the s-expr I'm
currently processing. If some shit will happen, let the user know."

As I said before, this library is a compatibility layer. Only SBCL and
Clasp are supported for now. On other implementations, the macro will do
nothing.
