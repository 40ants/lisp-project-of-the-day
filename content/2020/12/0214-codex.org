This is a documentation generator by Fernando Boretti.

It is built for extensibility and uses CommonDoc as an internal format
for document representation and manipulation.

Another interesting feature is a custom markup language. Actually, it
supports any number of markup languages, you just need to write a parser
from this markup into CommonDoc.

The sad part is that there is no support for cross-referencing and there are
a number of bugs :(

As always, I've created a template project for you, demonstrating how to
use Codex to document a simple Common Lisp library:
