This is yet another documentation builder for CL.

Its unique features are a special markup and ability to render
not only HTML, but also PDF and Info files.

As always, I've created an example project which can be used as a
template for your own library. Here how it is rendered in HTML:

This is how it is rendered into PDF:

Beautiful. Isn't it?

More pros and cons of ~ATDOC~ are listed in the repository's README:

Remember, all example projects from https://github.com/cl-doc-systems
include a build script and GitHub Action to update documentation on
every commit!
