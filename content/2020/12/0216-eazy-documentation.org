This is yet another documentation generator for Common Lisp, built by
"Masataro Asai".

It's unique feature is the documentation processor which is able to
extract docstring from nonstandard Lisp forms. Also, it supports
all markups, supported by [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] and can be used to generate
documentation from any folder.

You'll find more [[https://cl-doc-systems.github.io/eazy-documentation/#doc/source/1%20pros-n-cons.rst][pros and cons]] in the [[https://github.com/cl-doc-systems/eazy-documentation][template repository]] I've prepared
for you.

Despite many cool features, I have these stoppers for using Eazy
Documentation for my own projects:

- it is hard to control sections ordering;
- there is no a helper for cross-referencing symbols.

[[https://cl-doc-systems.github.io/mgl-pax/][MGL-PAX]], reviewed recently is still my favourite.
