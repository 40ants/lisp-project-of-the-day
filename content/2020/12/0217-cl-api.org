This is a small and simple documentation builder. It was [[https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/commit/e8c65442bbbfdfc0019f73513c8b15a04d134a4c][removed from
Quicklisp]] in 2014 because this project is SBCL only, but I've added it
to the [[https://ultralisp.org/][Ultralisp]] and you can test it after upgrade to the latest
version.

CL-API is suitable for building a reference for third-party libraries if
they don't have own documentation. But lack of ability to process
handwritten chapters and work with package inferred systems, make it
unusable for 40ants projects.

As alway, I've created a template repository for you.

Here is an example project's documentation built with CL-API:

https://cl-doc-systems.github.io/cl-api/

Use this template if you are making a small library which needs
autogenerated API reference.

Also, you'll find a Pros&Cons section in the README:
