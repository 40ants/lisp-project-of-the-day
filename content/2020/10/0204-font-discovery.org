This is a library by [[https://twitter.com/Shinmera][@Shinmera]] to find out which fonts are known to OS
and where their files are located.

Here is how you can list all "Arial" fonts and find where the "bold"
version is located:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (org.shirakumo.font-discovery:list-fonts :family "Arial")
(#<ORG.SHIRAKUMO.FONT-DISCOVERY:FONT "Arial" ROMAN REGULAR NORMAL>
 #<ORG.SHIRAKUMO.FONT-DISCOVERY:FONT "Arial" ITALIC REGULAR NORMAL>
 #<ORG.SHIRAKUMO.FONT-DISCOVERY:FONT "Arial" ROMAN BOLD NORMAL>
 #<ORG.SHIRAKUMO.FONT-DISCOVERY:FONT "Arial" ITALIC BOLD NORMAL>)

POFTHEDAY> (third *)
#<ORG.SHIRAKUMO.FONT-DISCOVERY:FONT "Arial" ROMAN BOLD NORMAL>

POFTHEDAY> (org.shirakumo.font-discovery:file *)
#P"/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Arial Bold.ttf"

#+end_src

It is also possible to find a single font filtering it by family, slant
and other parameters:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (org.shirakumo.font-discovery:find-font :family "PragmataPro")
#<ORG.SHIRAKUMO.FONT-DISCOVERY:FONT "PragmataPro" ROMAN REGULAR NORMAL>

POFTHEDAY> (describe *)
#<ORG.SHIRAKUMO.FONT-DISCOVERY:FONT "PragmataPro" ROMAN REGULAR NORMAL>
  [standard-object]

Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  FILE                           = #P"/Users/art/Library/Fonts/PragmataProR_0828.ttf"
  FAMILY                         = "PragmataPro"
  SLANT                          = :ROMAN
  WEIGHT                         = :REGULAR
  SPACING                        = NIL
  STRETCH                        = :NORMAL

#+end_src

However, I found this library is still unstable on OSX and sometimes
crashes somewhere in the CFFI code. @Shinmera has fixed some of these
errors but some of them are still uncaught.
