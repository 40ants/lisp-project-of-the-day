It has nothing in common with the magic artefact, but anyway is able to
do pretty cool things!

This library is a wrapper around [[https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/][Tesseract OCR]] and is suitable for an image
to text transformations.

To test this system, you need to install the ~Tesseract~ library first. On
OSX just do:

#+begin_src bash

brew install tesseract

#+end_src

The CL library is not in the Quicklisp but can be installed from the
https://ultralisp.org. Follow the instruction from the repository:

https://github.com/egao1980/tesseract-capi

To make it work, you'll need a trained data for Tesseract
engine. Happily, the Homebrew package includes some files for the
English language.

To find out a path, do:

#+begin_src bash

[poftheday] echo $(brew --prefix tesseract)/share/tessdata/
/usr/local/opt/tesseract/share/tessdata/

#+end_src

Now we can test this library on this sample from the repository:

[[../../media/0203/fox.png]]

Here is how to translate this image into the text:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (tesseract-capi::tessversion)
"4.1.1"

POFTHEDAY> (let ((tesseract-capi:*tessdata-directory*
                   "/usr/local/opt/tesseract/share/tessdata/"))
             (tesseract-capi:image-to-text
              (asdf:system-relative-pathname
               :tesseract-capi "tests/data/fox.png")))
"This is a lot of 12 point text to test the
ocr code and see if it works on all types
of fle format

The quick brown dog jumped over the
lazy fox. The quick brown dog jumped

"

#+end_src

Now let's try it on this [[https://xkcd.com/312/][XKCD]] comic:

[[../../media/0203/xkcd-312.png]]

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (let ((tesseract-capi:*tessdata-directory*
                   "/usr/local/opt/tesseract/share/tessdata/"))
             (tesseract-capi:image-to-text
              "docs/media/0203/xkcd-312.png"))
"A GODS LAMENT

#+end_src

As you can see, it outputs some junk at the end, but main text is
recognized almost perfectly!

I think, this is a pretty cool library! For example, you can use it plus
[[https://github.com/sharplispers/montezuma][Montezuma]] to build a personal search engine for your image and scans
collection. It's a matter of one night.
