This is the library for PDF generation and parsing.

Today I'm too lazy to provided step by step examples, but I have a real
task to do with this library.

Some time ago I've read the [[https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html][article about productivity]] which recommened to print a
"life calendar". This calendar should remind you: "The life is limited
and the time's price is high."

The calendar is a grid where every box is one week of you life. The
article suggested to buy a poster with the calendar, but I don't want to
wait a parcel with a poster I want to print it now!

And now cl-pdf comes on the scene!

I wrote this simple function to generate the poster of A1 format:

#+begin_src lisp



#+end_src
