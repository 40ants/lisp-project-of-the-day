This is the [[https://shinmera.github.io/trivial-thumbnail/][library]] by [[https://twitter.com/Shinmera][@Shinmera]]. It does one trivial thing - shrinks
images, squeezes them into smaller thumbnails. Actually, it is a wrapper
around [[https://imagemagick.org/][ImageMagick]].

The cool thing about this library is that it is able to preserve GIF
animations. This way you can create animated avatars for users of your
next-generation Facebook killer social network, written in Common Lisp!

For example, let's pretend the user loads this cute dog animation which
has 800Ã—800 pixels size, and weights 44KB:

[[../../media/0200/dog.gif]]

If we want our avatars to be 64x64 pixels, then ~trivial-thumbnail~ will
help us:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (trivial-thumbnail:create "docs/media/0200/dog.gif"
                                     "docs/media/0200/small-dog.gif"
                                     :width 64)
#P"docs/media/0200/small-dog.gif"

#+end_src

Here is the result:

[[../../media/0200/small-dog.gif]]

To make it work you have to install ImageMagick. On OSX the easiest way
to do this is to use Homebrew:

#+begin_src bash

brew install imagemagick

#+end_src

There are also other options. They are covered by [[https://shinmera.github.io/trivial-thumbnail/][documentation]].

Seems this is a cool library to make avatars, preview and thumbnails.
