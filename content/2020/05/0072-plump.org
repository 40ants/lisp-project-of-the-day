Yesterday [[https://twitter.com/Shinmera][@Shinmera]] mentioned Plump in the [[https://twitter.com/XH004][XH004]]'s [[https://twitter.com/XH004/status/1261861964818440192][thread]] about
performance optimization of it's new HTML parser. And I decided to
review it.

Plump is able to parse, modify and serialize a HTML back.

Let's write a crawler to grab @shinmera's posts from the Twitter!

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (defvar *raw-html*
              (dex:get "https://twitter.com/shinmera"))

;; We need all divs with class "tweet-text"
POFTHEDAY> (defvar *posts*
             (remove-if-not (lambda (div)
                              (str:containsp "tweet-text"
                                             (plump:attribute div "class")))
                            (plump:get-elements-by-tag-name *html* "p")))

POFTHEDAY> (loop for post in (rutils:take 5 *posts*)
                 for full-text = (plump:render-text post)
                 for short-text = (str:shorten 40 full-text)
                 do (format t "- ~A~2%" short-text))

It is better to use Plump together with another @shimera's library -
[[https://shinmera.github.io/CLSS/][clss]] but we'll play with it tomorrow :)
