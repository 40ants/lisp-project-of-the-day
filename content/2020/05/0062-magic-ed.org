This strange library replaces standard ~cl:ed~ function with a new one,
which executes editor specified in the ~EDITOR~ environment variable.

This does not work from SLY, so I had to run a raw REPL:

#+begin_src lisp

 * sb-ext:*ed-functions*
 NIL
 * (cl:ed "qlfile")

 debugger invoked on a SB-INT:EXTENSION-FAILURE in thread
 #<THREAD "main thread" RUNNING {1000518083}>:
   Don't know how to ED qlfile
 See also:
   The SBCL Manual, Variable *ED-FUNCTIONS*

 Type HELP for debugger help, or (SB-EXT:EXIT) to exit from SBCL.

 restarts (invokable by number or by possibly-abbreviated name):
   0: [ABORT] Exit debugger, returning to top level.

 (ED "qlfile")
 0] ^D
 * (ql:quickload :magic-ed)
 To load "magic-ed":
   Load 1 ASDF system:
     magic-ed
 ; Loading "magic-ed"

 (:MAGIC-ED)
 * sb-ext:*ed-functions*
 (MAGIC-ED:ED-EDITOR)
 * (cl:ed "qlfile")
 T

#+end_src

Also, this library provides a function ~magic-ed~ which is able to return
file's content and evaluate the lisp code:

#+begin_src lisp

 * (magic-ed:magic-ed "/tmp/foo" :output :string)
 "(format t \"Blah~%\")
 "
 *

#+end_src

Does somebody can tell me when this could be useful if you can just use
Emacs and SLIME?
