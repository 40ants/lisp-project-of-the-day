* bodge-blobs-support :asdf_extension:

This is a yet another ASDF extension. It is build by [[https://twitter.com/borodust][@borodust]] to
distribute a prebuilt C/C++ library wrappers he are making for gamedev.

Here is example of the system definition which uses
"bodge-blobs-support":

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

(asdf:defsystem chipmunk-blob
  :author "Pavel Korolev"
  :description "Chipmunk physics foreign library collection"
  :license "MIT"
  :defsystem-depends-on (:bodge-blobs-support)
  :class :bodge-blob-system
  :libraries (((:darwin :x86-64) "libchipmunk.dylib.bodged" "x86_64/")
              ((:darwin :x86) "libchipmunk.dylib.bodged" "x86/")
              ((:unix (:not :darwin) :x86-64) "libchipmunk.so.bodged" "x86_64/")
              ((:unix (:not :darwin) :x86) "libchipmunk.so.bodged" "x86/")
              ((:windows :x86-64) "libchipmunk.dll.bodged" "x86_64/")
              ((:windows :x86) "libchipmunk.dll.bodged" "x86/")))

#+END_SRC

This definition contains a list of libraries which should be loaded by
CFFI for different combinations of *features*.

When you load such a system, it automatically sets a path to the library
and loads it into the Lisp image:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

POFTHEDAY> (ql:quickload :chipmunk-blob)

POFTHEDAY> (bodge-blobs-support:list-registered-libraries)
(#P"/Users/art/poftheday/.qlot/dists/
    quicklisp/software/chipmunk-blob-stable-55c6bf5b-git/
    x86_64/libchipmunk.dylib.bodged")

POFTHEDAY> cffi:*foreign-library-directories*
(#P"/Users/art/poftheday/.qlot/dists/
    quicklisp/software/chipmunk-blob-stable-55c6bf5b-git/x86_64/"
   (CFFI::EXPLODE-PATH-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE "LD_LIBRARY_PATH")
   (CFFI::EXPLODE-PATH-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH")
   (UIOP/OS:GETCWD) (CFFI::DARWIN-FALLBACK-LIBRARY-PATH))

POFTHEDAY> (cffi:list-foreign-libraries)
(#<CFFI:FOREIGN-LIBRARY LIBCHIPMUNK.DYLIB.BODGED-743 "libchipmunk.dylib.bodged">
 #<CFFI:FOREIGN-LIBRARY LIBOSICAT "libosicat.dylib">)

#+END_SRC

As you can see, this way we can easily install a library from the
Quicklisp. It will bring all prebuilt binary parts for your system.

This extension can be used not only by gamedev libraries, but with any
library which need to interop with C/C++ code via a wrapper.
