This is a tiny library by Fernando Borretti. It implements analogue of
the UNIX utility ~which~:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "ls")
#P"/bin/ls"

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "sbcl")
#P"/Users/art/.bin/sbcl"

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "python3")
#P"/usr/bin/python3"

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "missing-binary")
NIL

#+end_src

By the way, there are many other trivial (but useful) librararies. All
of them are marked with a [[https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/tags/trivial.html][trivial tag]] on #pofthedday site.
