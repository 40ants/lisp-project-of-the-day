This is a tiny library by Fernando Borretti. It implements analogue of
the UNIX utility ~which~:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "ls")
#P"/bin/ls"

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "sbcl")
#P"/Users/art/.bin/sbcl"

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "python3")
#P"/usr/bin/python3"

POFTHEDAY> (which:which "missing-binary")
NIL

#+end_src

That is it. No more, no less. What do you think, when this library can be useful?

By the way, there are many other trivial (but useful) libraries. All
of them are marked with a [[https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/tags/trivial.html][trivial tag]] on #pofthedday site.
