This utility was made by me to help to collect reports from my
software. It is especially useful in CI pipeline, to log OS, Lisp and
systems versions.

Here is how it works:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (cl-info:get-cl-info)
OS:   Darwin 19.5.0
Lisp: SBCL 2.0.8
ASDF: 3.3.4
QL:   cl-json github-b93881029907ef17eb53754c9f0f4e3e
      quicklisp 2020-07-15
      ultralisp 20200910134005

POFTHEDAY> (cl-info:get-system-info :cl-who)
System: CL-WHO 1.1.4
        /Users/art/poftheday/.qlot/dists/ultralisp/software/edicl-cl-who-20190618200624/

POFTHEDAY> (cl-info:get-system-info :cl-json)
System: CL-JSON 0.5.0
        /Users/art/poftheday/.qlot/dists/cl-json/software/cl-json-master/

#+end_src

There is also a command-line utility with similar functionality. It can
be installed using [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell][Roswell]]:

#+begin_src bash

[poftheday]% ros install 40ants/cl-info
Installing from github 40ants/cl-info
...
[1/3] System 'cl-info' found. Loading the system..
[2/3] Processing build-hook..
[3/3] Attempting to install the scripts in roswell/ subdirectory of the system...
Found 1 scripts: cl-info
/Users/art/.roswell/bin/cl-info

#+end_src

Now you can call this utility from the command line. By default, it
outputs information about OS, Lisp, ASDF versions and installed
Quicklisp distributions.

But you can also specify system names to get additional information:

#+begin_src bash

[poftheday]% cl-info cl-who cl-json
OS:   Darwin 19.5.0
Lisp: SBCL 1.5.6
ASDF: 3.3.4
QL:   cl-json github-b93881029907ef17eb53754c9f0f4e3e
      quicklisp 2020-07-15
      ultralisp 20200910134005

System: cl-who 1.1.4
        /Users/art/poftheday/.qlot/dists/ultralisp/software/edicl-cl-who-20190618200624/

System: cl-json 0.5.0
        /Users/art/poftheday/.qlot/dists/cl-json/software/cl-json-master/

#+end_src

Again. This can be useful in CI pipelines or to output information when
your program is called with --version --verbose options.

This system is available from https://ultralisp.org and GitHub:
