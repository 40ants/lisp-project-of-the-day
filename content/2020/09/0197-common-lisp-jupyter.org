This library provides a Common Lisp kernel for [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]].

Jupyter is a scientific environment for experiments. It is good when you
want to play with data, to plot graphics and provide some comments in
markdown.

Jupyter saves your programming session along with results in one file
allowing to share your results with other programmers or
analytics.

Maybe you didn't know, but GitHub is able to render such notebooks. [[https://gist.github.com/ocoyawale/54d92fd4bf92508a2a6e482b5fa480fd][Here]]
I found a large list of interesting notebooks. Take a look at this one,
for example:

https://github.com/mqlaql/geospatial-data/blob/master/Geospatial-Data-with-Python.ipynb

Now, let's return to the Common Lisp. Jupyter is using a protocol
allowing to write backends in different programming languages. They are
called "kernels".

Here is how we can install Common Lisp Jupyter kernel on OSX. Here I'll
use [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] and [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell][Roswell]] because they are making everything so easy!

#+begin_src bash

[poftheday] brew install zeromq

[poftheday] brew install jupyterlab

[poftheday] ros install common-lisp-jupyter

#+end_src

Now we can start a notebook in console mode:

#+begin_src bash

[poftheday] jupyter console --kernel=common-lisp
Jupyter console 6.2.0

#+end_src

And this command will start a webserver with full Jupyter Notebook:

#+begin_src bash

# To start a web UI, run
[poftheday] jupyter notebook

#+end_src

When browser will open Jupyter, choose this menu to start Common Lisp
Jupyter kernel:

Now if you enter the same code as we did before in console, you'll see,
that web version is able to render our "screenshot" file below the
"code cell":

[[../../media/0197/02-basic-code.png]]

It is also very easy to render formulas and to request an input from the user:

[[../../media/0197/03-latex-formula.png]]

Also, you can render any HTML along with styles:

[[../../media/0197/04-rendering-any-html.png]]

Or you might define a functions which will return HTML or files:

[[../../media/0197/05-returning-html-from-a-function.png]]

This way, a libraries extending ~common-lis-jupyter~ maybe created. They
can do plotting for example, or render graphs, etc.

Here how you can made you own classes renderable by Jupyter:

[[../../media/0197/06-custom-renderable.png]]

Though, it would be nice to make it possible to define ~render~ method.

This project is in active development phase. For example right now
support for Jupyter widgets is added.

Please, join this effort and make your pull requests to [[https://github.com/yitzchak/common-lisp-jupyter][this reporitory]],
if you are interested in building CL environment for data science!
