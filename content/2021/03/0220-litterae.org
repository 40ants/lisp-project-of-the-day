This is yet another Common Lisp documentation builder.

It renders beautiful one-page docs. Sadly, Litterae
itself has no documentation. I've used it to document Teddy
and also created a template project for you:

https://github.com/cl-doc-systems/litterae

Why Litterae can be interesting for you:

- It uses README.md as documentation source.
- Litterae builds API reference from docstrings.
- It provides four color themes.
- It uses [[https://github.com/fukamachi/lsx][LSX]] for templating and probably there is a way
  to create a custom HTML.

However, there are many problems with Litterae. It seems
not mature enough to use in my projects. To name a single
feature I miss is cross-referencing. That is the main reason,
why I'll not use it for my libraries.
