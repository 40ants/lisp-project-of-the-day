Do+ is a macro, similar to &#039;loop&#039; or &#039;iterate&#039;, but built with
simplicity in mind.

Documentation is good and contains some examples showing how does
iteration works and how to extend the behaviour and add new iteration
methods.

Here is a simple iteration on the list:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (use-package :doplus)
T
POFTHEDAY&gt; (do+
             (for i (in &quot;Hello world!&quot;))
             (collect i))
(#\H #\e #\l #\l #\o #\  #\w #\o #\r #\l #\d #\!)

#+end_src

Now let&#039;s try to extend do+ to iterate on week days:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (defclause in-days ()
             `(for ,*iteration-variable*
                   (in &#039;(:monday :tuesday :wednesday
                         :thursday :friday :saturday :sunday))))

POFTHEDAY&gt; (do+
             (for day (in-days))
             (format t &quot;Hello ~A~%&quot; day))
Hello MONDAY
Hello TUESDAY
Hello WEDNESDAY
Hello THURSDAY
Hello FRIDAY
Hello SATURDAY
Hello SUNDAY

#+end_src

Another cool feature is support for generators. BTW, :iterate supports
them too.

Let&#039;s try to build a generator which emits an infinite sequence of
Fibonacci numbers.

The first step is to implement the iteration in do+ terms:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (do+
             (with (prev 0))
             (for x (being 1 :then (prog1 (+ prev x)
                                     (setf prev x))))
             (format t &quot;prev: ~A x: ~A~%&quot; prev x)
             (stop-when (&gt; x 100)))
prev: 0 x: 1
prev: 1 x: 1
prev: 1 x: 2
prev: 2 x: 3
prev: 3 x: 5
prev: 5 x: 8
prev: 8 x: 13
prev: 13 x: 21
prev: 21 x: 34
prev: 34 x: 55
prev: 55 x: 89

#+end_src

Next, we need to wrap it into the defclause.

This clause can be used in any do+ loops and will be lazily evaluated:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (defclause in-fib ()
             `((with (prev 0))
               (for ,*iteration-variable*
                    (being 1 :then (prog1 (+ prev ,*iteration-variable*)
                                     (setf prev ,*iteration-variable*))))))

;; Now we can use it as a clause inside another do+ form:
POFTHEDAY&gt; (do+
             (for x (in-fib))
             (format t &quot;x: ~A~%&quot; x)
             (stop-when (&gt; x 100)))
x: 1
x: 1
x: 2
x: 3
x: 5
x: 8
x: 13
x: 21
x: 34
x: 55
x: 89
NIL

#+end_src
