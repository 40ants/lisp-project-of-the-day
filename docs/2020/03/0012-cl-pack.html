It supplies Perl/PHP/Ruby/Python compatible pack() and unpack()
functions to allow easy use of (binary format) protocols and files with
the above-mentioned languages and C.

I&#039;ve tested :cl-pack using an example from its README. Seems
it does not work as expected, because it is unable to unpack the data,
created by itself:

#+begin_src lisp

 POFTHEDAY&gt; (defparameter *data*
              (cl-pack:pack &quot;VgA*c*&quot;
                            #x41424344
                            161.99
                            &quot; a string &quot;
                            69 70 71))
 *DATA*
 POFTHEDAY&gt; *data*
 &quot;DCBAC!&#253;q a string EFG&quot;
 POFTHEDAY&gt; (cl-pack:unpack &quot;VgA*c*&quot; *data*)
 1094861636 (31 bits, #x41424344)
 161.99
 &quot;a string EFG&quot;

#+end_src

As you can see, it wasn&#039;t able to unpack three unsigned chars from the
end of the structure.

I&#039;ve decided :cl-pack isn&#039;t able to distinguish the end of the line, and
changed format string to the null-terminated string.

But it doesn&#039;t work either:

#+begin_src lisp

 POFTHEDAY&gt; (defparameter *data*
              (cl-pack:pack &quot;VgZ*c*&quot;
                            #x41424344
                            161.99
                            &quot;a string&quot;
                            69 70 71))
 *DATA*
 POFTHEDAY&gt; *data*
 &quot;DCBAC!&#253;qa string^@EFG&quot;
 POFTHEDAY&gt; (cl-pack:unpack &quot;VgZ*c*&quot; *data*)
 1094861636 (31 bits, #x41424344)
 161.99
 &quot;a string^@EFG&quot;

#+end_src

Is it a fail, or I just did something wrong?
