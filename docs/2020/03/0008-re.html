This is a small regular expressions engine, made by Jeffrey Massung
(@codeninja_blog).

This engine uses [[http://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html][Lua&#039;s regexp syntax]].

By the way, I was interested in why did Lua developers choose such syntax
over common Posix/Perl syntax. I found this interesting email from 
Philippe Lhoste:

http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2001-04/msg00244.html

In short, this alternative syntax was chosen to not support all the
features from Perl regexps and to make Lua&#039;s implementation short.

Today lua code contains 628 lines with regexp implementation:

https://github.com/lua/lua/blob/e4607523234f16ed9ed0436340b9315377dbfe7f/lstrlib.c#L352-L980

Common Lisp version is about 645 lines but is based on a separate
parser library.

I am wondering how does re&#039;s performance compare with cl-ppcre? Let&#039;s check!

We will test performance on a simple example. It will extract a
subreddit&#039;s name from the URL:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (cl-ppcre:register-groups-bind
               (subreddit)
               (&quot;.*/r/(.*?)/&quot;
                &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/&quot;)
             subreddit)
&quot;Common_Lisp&quot;

POFTHEDAY&gt; (first
            (re:match-groups
             (re:match-re #r&quot;.*/r/(.-)/&quot;
                          &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/&quot;)))
&quot;Common_Lisp&quot;

#+end_src

Here is what I&#039;ve got running cl-ppcre 1 million times:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (time
            (loop repeat *num-iterations*
                  do (cl-ppcre:register-groups-bind
                         (subreddit)
                         (&quot;.*/r/(.*?)/&quot;
                          &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/&quot;)
                       subreddit)))
Evaluation took:
  0.731 seconds of real time
  0.615337 seconds of total run time (0.541851 user, 0.073486 system)
  [ Run times consist of 0.061 seconds GC time, and 0.555 seconds non-GC time. ]
  84.13% CPU
  1,614,120,972 processor cycles
  956 page faults
  160,002,992 bytes consed

#+end_src

And here is the result of the same amount of iterations for &#039;re&#039;:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (time
            (loop repeat *num-iterations*
                  do (first
                      (re:match-groups
                       (re:match-re #r&quot;.*/r/(.-)/&quot;
                                    &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/&quot;)))))
Evaluation took:
  14.116 seconds of real time
  14.126191 seconds of total run time (14.056847 user, 0.069344 system)
  [ Run times consist of 0.301 seconds GC time, and 13.826 seconds non-GC time. ]
  100.07% CPU
  31,167,841,926 processor cycles
  2 page faults
  3,824,010,656 bytes consed

#+end_src

As you can see, cl-ppre is 20 times faster and consumes less memory than &#039;re&#039;.

It would be interesting to compare cl-ppcre with other regexp
engines. I&#039;ve found a test suite which already compares many engines:

https://github.com/rust-leipzig/regex-performance

But that is the story for another thread.
