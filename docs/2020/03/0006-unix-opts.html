<html><body><h1 class='title'>unix-opts</h1>There are many command-line parsing libraries for Common Lisp. This one
pretends to simplicity.

Unix-opts has an interesting feature - it uses CL&#039;s restarts to allow you
to decide what to do if the option is not supported or can&#039;t be parsed.

Here is a short example:

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY&gt; (opts:get-opts (list &quot;myscript&quot;
                                &quot;--help&quot;))
; Debugger entered on #&lt;UNIX-OPTS:UNKNOWN-OPTION {1001CBE413}&gt;
[1] POFTHEDAY&gt; 
; Evaluation aborted on #&lt;UNIX-OPTS:UNKNOWN-OPTION {1001CBE413}&gt;

;; We can solve this problem by calling a restart to skip and option
;; or consider the problem is critical and finish the program.
POFTHEDAY&gt; (handler-bind ((opts:unknown-option
                            (lambda (condition)
                              (format t &quot;Warning: ~s option is unknown!~%&quot;
                                      (opts:option condition))
                              (invoke-restart &#039;opts:skip-option))))
             (opts:get-opts (list &quot;myscript&quot;
                                  &quot;--help&quot;)))
Warning: &quot;--help&quot; option is unknown!
NIL
(&quot;myscript&quot;)

#+end_src

Options are declared by a macro opts:define-opts it stores them in the
global opts::*options* variable.

Seems there is no way to have subcommands with different options when
you are using unix-opts.

Internal code of the unix-opts is short, readable and documented. The
library has no dependencies which is good if you want to write simple
command-line scripts in Common Lisp.
