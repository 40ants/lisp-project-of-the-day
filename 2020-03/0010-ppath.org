* ppath :system:

This library brings Python's os.path API into the Common Lisp world.

It manipulates by strings rather than by CL's pathnames.

Ppath has pretty good documentation. I'll show only one example
description of all available functions you'll find in the docs:

http://quickdocs.org/ppath/

#+begin_src lisp

POFTHEDAY> (ppath:join "." "foo" "bar")
"./foo/bar"

POFTHEDAY> (ppath:exists (ppath:join "/tmp/" "foo"))
T

POFTHEDAY> (ppath:abspath ".")
"/Users/art/projects/lisp/lisp-project-of-the-day"

POFTHEDAY> (ppath:dirname (ppath:abspath "."))
"/Users/art/projects/lisp"

POFTHEDAY> (ppath:splitext "/tmp/some-file.jpg")
("/tmp/some-file" . ".jpg")

POFTHEDAY> (ppath:expandvars "/home/${LOGNAME}/bin")
"/home/art/bin"

#+end_src
